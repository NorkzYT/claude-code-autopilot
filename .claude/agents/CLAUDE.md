# Agent Catalog and Guidelines

This directory contains all agent definitions for the Claude Code autopilot system.

## Agent Architecture

Agents follow the **Orchestrator -> Explorer/Coder** pattern:
- **Orchestrator agents** plan and delegate (cannot directly modify code)
- **Explorer agents** investigate and report findings
- **Coder agents** implement changes with full tool access

## Available Agents

### Core Workflow Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Tools |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `autopilot` | Cost-optimized one-shot delivery (inherits current model; Sonnet-first) | Full access |
| `autopilot-opus` | High-confidence one-shot delivery for complex/high-risk tasks | Full access |
| `parallel-orchestrator` | Orchestrates parallel agent deployment | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, Task |
| `orchestrator` | Planning only, forced delegation | Read, Glob, Grep, Task |
| `autopilot-fixer` | Fix-up pass for incomplete work | Full access |
| `closer` | Verification, lifecycle check, and PR-ready summary | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, Task |

### Specialized Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Tools |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `promptsmith` | Converts raw tasks into execution-ready prompts | Read only |
| `shipper` | Lightweight inspect -> implement -> verify | Full access |
| `triage` | Debugging and root cause analysis | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash |
| `surgical-reviewer` | Code review focused on correctness | Read, Glob, Grep |
| `runbook` | Generates next-action prompts when stuck | Read only |
| `accessibility-auditor` | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit and remediation | Full access |

## Full Engineering Lifecycle

The autopilot pipeline now includes full lifecycle verification:

```
Fix -> Build -> Test -> Confirm -> Deploy -> Verify CI -> Next Issue
```

### Lifecycle-Aware Agents

| Agent | Lifecycle Role |
|-------|----------------|
| `autopilot` | Runs full lifecycle (step 6: build/test/confirm via openclaw-local-workflow.sh) |
| `autopilot` | Deploys on feature branch (step 8b: commit/push/CI monitor) |
| `closer` | Verifies lifecycle passed (step 3b: reads workflow-report.local.json) |

### Lifecycle Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `.claude/scripts/openclaw-local-workflow.sh` | Runs build -> run -> test -> confirm from TOOLS.md |
| `.claude/bootstrap/analyze_repo.sh` | Auto-detects BUILD/TEST/RUN/CONFIRM commands -> TOOLS.md |

### Issue Lifecycle Skill

After a fix is deployed, use the `issue-lifecycle` skill to:
- Close the resolved issue with a commit reference
- List the next open bugs/issues
- Present options to the user

See `.claude/skills/issue-lifecycle/SKILL.md` for details.

## Spawning Agents

Use the Task tool to spawn agents:

```
Task tool with subagent_type=<agent-name>
```

Example:
```
Use the autopilot-opus subagent (Task tool with subagent_type=autopilot-opus) for this task
```

## Agent Design Patterns

### 1. Forced Delegation Pattern

The `orchestrator` agent cannot directly access code. It must:
1. Analyze the task and decompose into subtasks
2. Spawn specialist agents for each subtask
3. Aggregate results from sub-agents
4. Report distilled context (not raw output)

### 2. Parallel Agent Deployment

When tasks have independent components:
- Fan-out: Spawn 2-4 agents for independent subtasks
- Pipeline: Run different stages in parallel
- Swarm: Multiple coders on different features

Bounded concurrency: Max 2-4 concurrent agents to avoid context confusion.

### 3. Context Store Pattern

Sub-agents work with full context but report only:
- Key findings (not full file contents)
- Decisions made (not exploration history)
- Verification results (pass/fail + summary)

This prevents context explosion in the parent agent.

## Creating New Agents

Agent files follow this frontmatter format:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
model: opus
description: One-line purpose statement
tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, Edit, Write, Task
---
```

After frontmatter, include:
1. Purpose statement
2. Hard rules (constraints)
3. Workflow (numbered steps)
4. Input/output format

## Ralph Loop Integration

Agents can run inside Ralph loops for guaranteed task completion.

### Recommended Execution

Use `/ship` for fire-and-forget execution:
```
/ship "Build a REST API with tests"
```

### How It Works

1. `/ship` creates a Ralph loop with `TASK_COMPLETE` promise
2. Autopilot executes the full pipeline (including lifecycle verification)
3. Closer verifies DoD + lifecycle and outputs `<promise>TASK_COMPLETE</promise>` when done
4. Loop continues if promise not output

### Agent Responsibilities in Ralph Loops

- **autopilot**: Check `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` at start; run full lifecycle; aware of iteration count
- **closer**: Final gate; verifies lifecycle passed; outputs completion promise when DoD met

See `.claude/hooks/CLAUDE.md` for full Ralph loop documentation.
