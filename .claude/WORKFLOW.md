# Claude Code Session Startup Guide (My Workflow)

This file is for **my own reference**: how I start Claude Code sessions, when I use plan mode, and how I run tasks end-to-end using my agents (Promptsmith / Shipper / Runbook).

---

## Core principles (keep it simple)

- **Smallest change that works.**
- **Discover repo context first** (search + read) before deciding architecture.
- **Always include verification** (tests/lint/build or clear manual checks).
- **Logging rule:** use `internalLog.{debug,info,warn,error}` when adding logs.

---

## Recommended start command (safe default)

Prefer starting in plan mode:

````bash
claude --permission-mode plan


Then move to execution when the plan is good:

```bash
claude --permission-mode ask
# or (if you fully trust your allowlist/hooks)
claude --permission-mode allow
````

---

## If I insist on using `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

### Reality check

Using:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

means:

- Claude can run tools/commands without asking.
- **My hooks/guards become my primary safety net.**
- Any overly-broad formatter hook can cause noisy diffs.
- Any missing deny pattern can cause damage.

### When I use it

Only when ALL of the following are true:

- Repo is trusted + local environment is safe.
- My `guard_bash.py` is active.
- My denylist blocks destructive/network/privileged commands.
- I’m doing a focused change (not exploratory/random commands).

### Extra precautions (do these)

- Keep `git commit` denied by default.
- Keep network tools denied (`curl`, `wget`, `ssh`, `scp`, `rsync`).
- Keep deletes denied (`rm`, `del`, `rmdir`).
- Prefer formatting only **edited files**, not `prettier --write .`.

## My standard flow (Promptsmith → Shipper → Review → Runbook)

### 0) Open repo root

```bash
cd /path/to/repo
```

### 1) Start Claude Code

Pick one:

**Safer (recommended):**

```bash
claude --permission-mode plan
```

**Fast (risky):**

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

### 2) Convert my raw task into an execution-ready starter prompt

Use the Promptsmith subagent:

```text
Use the promptsmith subagent.

INPUT
<<<
<PASTE MY RAW TASK HERE>
>>>
```

Promptsmith outputs:

- CLAUDE CODE STARTER PROMPT (pasteable)
- ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- DEBUGGING PLAYBOOK
- FOLLOW-UP PROMPTS
- RISKS & TRAPS

### 3) Execute with Shipper

Take Promptsmith’s “CLAUDE CODE STARTER PROMPT” and run:

```text
Use the shipper subagent.

<PASTE THE STARTER PROMPT HERE>
```

**In plan mode**, Shipper should:

- restate goal + assumptions
- produce TODO + file targets
- propose verification commands
  I confirm it looks sane, then switch permission mode and say “Proceed.”

### 4) Quick review pass (optional and recommended)

```text
Use the surgical-reviewer subagent.

Review the recent changes and call out risks, missed edge cases, and any style mismatches.
```

### 5) If stuck or “fixed” and still broken → Runbook

```text
Use the runbook subagent.

Original Task:
<<<
<PASTE>
>>>

Claude Output / Transcript:
<<<
<PASTE>
>>>

Observed Behavior / Logs:
<<<
<PASTE>
>>>
```

Runbook returns the exact next message I should paste.

## Default “Kickoff prompt” template (use instead of giant identity prompts)

I do NOT need “You are a master developer…”. Use this:

```text
Operating rules:
- Start with TODO + Definition of Done.
- Discover repo context via rg/read before deciding.
- Make the smallest change that satisfies the task; follow existing patterns.
- Logs must use internalLog.{debug,info,warn,error}.
- Always include verification steps and report exactly what you ran + results.

Task:
<PASTE TASK>

Definition of done:
- [ ] <measurable outcome 1>
- [ ] <measurable outcome 2>
- [ ] Verification passes (tests/lint/build or explicit manual checks)
```

---

## “MVP Foundation + Offline Architecture + Repo/Environments” flow

When the task is strategic (docs + architecture + scaffolding), do this:

1. Start in plan mode:

```bash
claude --permission-mode plan
```

2. Run Promptsmith on my MVP scope:

- Ask it to produce:
  - scope boundaries (in/out)
  - offline strategy (storage/sync/conflicts/failure modes)
  - repo layout + env strategy (dev/staging/prod)
  - week 1/week 2 milestones
  - verification steps

3. Run Shipper to:

- inspect repo (if exists)
- write docs:
  - `docs/architecture/offline.md` (or similar)
  - `docs/environments.md`
  - `docs/repo-structure.md`

- add minimal scaffolding (only if needed):
  - example `.env.example`
  - env validation (if repo already has a pattern)
  - basic folder structure (only if repo is empty)

4. Switch to ask/allow for actual file changes.

## My “done” checklist (before I stop)

- [ ] TODO items completed or explicitly deferred
- [ ] Definition of Done satisfied
- [ ] Verification commands run (or clear manual checks listed)
- [ ] Summary includes:
  - what changed
  - where to look
  - how to run checks
  - follow-ups / risks

---

## Notes for my current permissions setup

- I deny `git commit`, I either:
  - commit manually myself, or
  - temporarily allow commit for a specific command (preferred: manual)

- If formatting is noisy, disable formatting hook or make it per-file.
