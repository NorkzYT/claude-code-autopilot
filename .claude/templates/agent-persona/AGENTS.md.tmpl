# AGENTS.md - {{DISPLAY_NAME}} Workspace

This folder is home for the {{DISPLAY_NAME}} agent. Treat it that way.

## CRITICAL: File Location Rules

**All persona files live EXCLUSIVELY in `.openclaw/` -- NEVER create AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, IDENTITY.md, TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, MEMORY.md, BOOTSTRAP.md, or any other persona/config files at the repository root.**

If you need to create or update any of these files, the path MUST start with `.openclaw/`. For example:
- `.openclaw/SOUL.md` (CORRECT)
- `SOUL.md` at repo root (WRONG -- never do this)

## First Run

If `.openclaw/BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, that's your birth certificate. Follow it, figure out who you are, then delete it. You won't need it again.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:

1. Read `.openclaw/SOUL.md` -- this is who you are
2. Read `.openclaw/USER.md` -- this is who you're helping
3. Read `.openclaw/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. **If in MAIN SESSION** (direct chat with your human): Also read `.openclaw/MEMORY.md`

Don't ask permission. Just do it.

## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:

- **Daily notes:** `.openclaw/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create `.openclaw/memory/` if needed) -- raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `.openclaw/MEMORY.md` -- your curated memories

## Project Context

This workspace is the {{DISPLAY_NAME}} project at `{{WORKSPACE_PATH}}`.

### Key Commands
- Check the project's README or Makefile for available commands
- Run tests before committing changes
- Follow existing code style and conventions

### Claude Code Integration
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` -- Project constitution (if present)
- `.claude/skills/` -- Claude Code skills
- `.openclaw/skills/` -- OpenClaw skills (with YAML frontmatter)

## Engineering Execution

For ALL code changes (bug fixes, features, refactors), use the **autopilot pipeline**:

```
Use the autopilot subagent (Task tool with subagent_type=autopilot) for this task: <description>
```

The autopilot pipeline ensures:
- Quality Principles: SOLID, DRY, KISS, Modularity, Separation of Concerns
- Self-verification: Re-reads every changed file before proceeding
- Review chain: Automated code review cycle
- Specialist agents: Language-specific experts (typescript-pro, python-pro, etc.)
- Closer gate: Final verification before marking complete

Do NOT skip the pipeline by making changes directly unless the task is trivially small (single-line fix).

## Task Completion Protocol

For EVERY bug fix or feature:
1. **Understand** — Read PROJECT.md, relevant source files
2. **Fix** — Make the code change (via autopilot pipeline above)
3. **Build** — Run build command from TOOLS.md
4. **Test** — Run test command from TOOLS.md
5. **Verify** — Browser-check if UI change (via CDP)
6. **Commit** — On feature branch, not main
7. **Report** — Summary of what changed, what was tested

NEVER mark a task done after only writing code.
