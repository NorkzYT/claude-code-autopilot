# Claude Code Autopilot Kit (Claude + OpenClaw Engineer Workflow Kit)

A portable `.claude/` bundle for Claude Code with a staged agent workflow, safety hooks, logging, and a strict verification loop.

It also includes OpenClaw and CrewAI bootstrap scripts for remote control, browser automation, multi-agent routing, and cross-session memory.

This repo is built to support a full local engineer workflow:

- fix
- build
- run local stack (`yarn dev`, `make up`, `docker compose up`)
- test
- confirm
- commit and report

The goal is not code-only output. The goal is a repeatable engineering loop.

Once installed, Claude can auto-route substantive tasks into the autopilot pipeline and use OpenClaw when you enable it.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorkzYT/claude-code-autopilot/main/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --repo NorkzYT/claude-code-autopilot --ref main --force --bootstrap-linux
```

After install, you'll see your **ntfy.sh subscription URL** — subscribe to get notified when Claude needs your attention.

Then restart Claude Code to load the new configuration.

> **Note:** Run Claude Code as a **non-root user**. The kit's hooks, logs, and VS Code integration are designed for regular user accounts. If using VS Code Remote (SSH/Tailscale), ensure you attach as the same user that runs Claude.

### Install With OpenClaw (Discord/browser/multi-agent)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorkzYT/claude-code-autopilot/main/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --repo NorkzYT/claude-code-autopilot --ref main --force --bootstrap-linux --with-openclaw
```

### OpenClaw Docker Quickstart

For a new user who wants Docker-only OpenClaw with access to repos under `/opt/repos`:

1. Install with `--with-openclaw`
2. Copy the env template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit `.env` and set:
   - `HOST_REPOS_DIR=/opt/repos`
   - `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`
   - `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`
   - `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`
   - `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`

Recommended defaults:
   - `OPENCLAW_MODEL_PRIMARY=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`
   - `OPENCLAW_THINKING_DEFAULT=high`

Optional auth envs:
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `OPENCLAW_ANTHROPIC_SETUP_TOKEN`

4. Put the repos you want OpenClaw to access under `/opt/repos`
5. Start the Docker stack after `.env` is ready:

```bash
openclaw up
```

6. Authenticate providers inside the container wrapper:

Anthropic subscription:

```bash
claude setup-token
openclaw models auth paste-token --provider anthropic
```

OpenAI subscription:

```bash
openclaw models auth login --provider openai-codex
```

7. Verify the stack:

```bash
openclaw status
openclaw logs
```

8. Open the browser viewer when manual login or 2FA is needed:

```bash
openclaw viewer-url
```

9. Register mounted repos as agents when needed:

```bash
openclaw agents add my-app --workspace /opt/repos/my-app --non-interactive
```

What this means:
- OpenClaw runs in Docker, not on the host
- the host `openclaw` command is a wrapper into the container
- `/opt/repos` is mounted read/write into the gateway container
- `~/.openclaw` on the host is bind-mounted into the container and reused for state
- if you ever need a different host state path, set `OPENCLAW_HOST_STATE_DIR` explicitly

### Install With CrewAI (marketing/research/ops crews)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorkzYT/claude-code-autopilot/main/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --repo NorkzYT/claude-code-autopilot --ref main --force --bootstrap-linux --with-crewai
```

### Install With OpenClaw + CrewAI Together

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorkzYT/claude-code-autopilot/main/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --repo NorkzYT/claude-code-autopilot --ref main --force --bootstrap-linux --with-openclaw --with-crewai
```

## Start Here

Pick one path:

1. Claude Code only (local terminal workflow): use the Quick Install command above
2. Claude Code + OpenClaw (Discord, browser, remote control): add `--with-openclaw`
3. Claude Code + CrewAI (crew-based domain teams): add `--with-crewai`
4. Claude Code + OpenClaw + CrewAI: use both flags in one command
5. Refresh an existing repo: re-run the install command with `--force`

What this kit covers:

- Claude Code hooks and guardrails (`.claude/hooks/*`)
- staged agent workflow (autopilot, triage, fixer, closer)
- OpenClaw gateway, Discord, browser, and agent bootstrap scripts
- CrewAI bootstrap with a marketing crew scaffold under `.crewai/`
- Codex compatibility layer (`AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills`, `.codex/rules`)

Then read:

- `.claude/README-openclaw.md` for OpenClaw scripts and common commands
- `.claude/docs/openclaw-integration.md` for full setup and troubleshooting
- `.claude/docs/openclaw-remote-commands.md` for Discord use (slash commands, pairing, allowlists, bindings)
- `docs/crewai.md` for CrewAI setup, execution, and artifact workflow

## Terminal Names & `cca` Alias

Each Claude Code session gets a **random memorable name** (e.g., `cosmic-penguin`, `thunder-falcon`) so you can easily identify multiple terminals. The name appears in:

- The **terminal tab title**
- **Notification messages** (so you know which terminal needs attention)
- A local identity file at `.claude/terminal-identity.local.json`

Launch Claude with the **`cca` alias** (added to your shell during install):

```bash
cca
```

This runs `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` with automatic terminal naming. Equivalent to:

```bash
.claude/bin/claude-named --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

> **Note:** After install, open a new shell or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`) to activate the `cca` alias.

## How It Works

After installation, the kit automatically:

1. **Injects autopilot** — A hook detects substantive prompts and triggers the autopilot agent
2. **Guards dangerous operations** — Blocks `rm -rf`, `sudo`, `curl|bash`, auto-commits, etc.
3. **Protects sensitive files** — Blocks edits to `.env`, secrets, certs, prod configs
4. **Auto-formats code** — Runs Prettier/Black on edited files when configured
5. **Logs everything** — Prompts, commands, and responses go to `.claude/logs/`

If you install with OpenClaw, it also:

6. **Adds gateway tooling** — Remote access, channel routing, and session management
7. **Adds browser tooling** — OpenClaw-managed browser for local UI verification and CDP flows
8. **Bootstraps repo agents** — Generates root OpenClaw core files, `.openclaw/` runtime state, skills, and compatibility files for multi-repo work

If you install with CrewAI, it also:

9. **Scaffolds a CrewAI workspace** — Generates `.crewai/` with agents/tasks config and Python entrypoints
10. **Creates growth artifacts** — Produces go-to-market, experiment backlog, and weekly ops outputs under `.crewai/reports/`
11. **Adds a local runner** — `.claude/scripts/crewai-local-workflow.sh` for CLI-driven automation
12. **Supports local proxy mode** — `.claude/scripts/crewai-cliproxyapi.sh` to run Dockerized CLIProxyAPI for subscription-backed routing

## Usage Guide

### Just Ask Naturally

For most tasks, simply describe what you want:

```
Add a logout button to the navbar that clears the session and redirects to /login
```

The autopilot agent automatically:
- Explores the codebase to understand the structure
- Plans the implementation
- Makes the changes
- Verifies the result
- Reviews for issues

### Structured Prompts (For Complex Tasks)

For complex or multi-step tasks, use this structure for best results:

```
1) GOAL
- Add user authentication with JWT tokens

2) DEFINITION OF DONE
- [ ] Login endpoint returns JWT on valid credentials
- [ ] Protected routes reject requests without valid token
- [ ] Tests pass

3) CONTEXT
- Using Express.js backend in /src/api
- User model already exists at /src/models/user.js

4) DETAILS
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Token expiry: 24 hours
```

### Skip Autopilot for Simple Questions

Simple questions bypass autopilot automatically:

```
What files handle authentication?
How does the routing work?
Explain the database schema
```

>>>

What's Still Wrong:
<<<
[paste error messages or describe the issue]
>>>
```

### Final Verification Before PR

```

## Core Principles

1. **Smallest change that satisfies the task** — No drive-by refactors
2. **Discovery first** — Search and read before deciding
3. **Always verify** — Run tests/lint/build or provide manual steps
4. **One bounded retry** — Triage → patch → verify once if it fails
5. **No destructive commands** — Unless explicitly approved
