# OpenClaw Setup (Quick Guide)

This page is a short entry point. The full OpenClaw guides live in `.claude/docs/`.

## What OpenClaw Adds

- Discord remote control (slash commands and channel bindings)
- Browser automation with a Docker-hosted managed browser
- Live browser viewer for manual login and takeover via noVNC
- Cron jobs and automation
- Gateway and multi-agent routing
- Cross-session memory and search

## Quick Setup

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NorkzYT/claude-code-autopilot/main/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --repo NorkzYT/claude-code-autopilot --ref main --force --bootstrap-linux --with-openclaw
```

Then:

The Docker/OpenClaw install defaults to `/opt/openclaw-home` when `--dest` is omitted.

1. Optional overrides: `cp /opt/openclaw-home/.env.example /opt/openclaw-home/.env`
2. Edit `/opt/openclaw-home/.env` before first startup
3. Start or restart the Docker stack from `/opt/openclaw-home`: `make start`
4. Authenticate Anthropic subscription inside the container: `make auth-anthropic`
5. Authenticate OpenAI subscription inside the container when needed: `make auth-openai`
6. Open the browser viewer: `make viewer-url`
7. Run Discord setup if needed: `make setup-discord`
8. Register extra repos under `/opt/repos` if needed: `make add-agent AGENT=<agent-id> REPO=/opt/repos/<repo-name>`

Important:

- Default repo mount is `${HOST_REPOS_DIR:-/opt/repos}` on the host to `/opt/repos` in the container.
- OpenClaw is not installed on the host in the default flow. The `openclaw` command is a host wrapper into Docker.
- `OPENCLAW_THINKING_DEFAULT=high` is the recommended default when `OPENCLAW_MODEL_PRIMARY=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- Use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` for direct API-key auth. Use in-container auth commands for subscription-backed auth.
- Host OpenClaw state automatically defaults to `~/.openclaw`, bind-mounted into the container. Only set `OPENCLAW_HOST_STATE_DIR` if you want a non-default path.
- Host services are reachable from the container at `http://host.docker.internal:<port>`. For example, a host dev server on port `8080` should be accessed as `http://host.docker.internal:8080` from OpenClaw.
- Control UI pairing: `127.0.0.1` is auto-approved. Same-host Tailnet access may also count as local, but other Tailnet/LAN clients still require explicit device approval.
- `PROJECT.md` is generated only by deep analysis.

## Browser Login and Takeover

Use the noVNC viewer when you need to watch the browser or log into a site manually:

```bash
make viewer-url
```

Open the printed URL in your browser, complete the login in the viewer, then return to OpenClaw commands. The browser profile persists in the host `~/.openclaw` state directory across container restarts.

For OpenAI subscription OAuth inside Docker, run:

```bash
make auth-openai
```

If the callback flow cannot complete automatically, use OpenClaw's printed fallback prompt to paste the redirect URL or code back into the container session.

## Claude Max Proxy Setup

The installer clones `claude-max-api-proxy` and runs it as a container in the stack. It provides an OpenAI-compatible API backed by your Claude Max subscription through the Claude CLI.

**Prerequisites:** The Claude CLI must be installed and authenticated on the host before starting the stack.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude auth login
```

After `make start`, the proxy is reachable from the OpenClaw gateway at `http://claude-max-proxy:3456/v1`.

**Configure OpenClaw to use the proxy.** Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and update two sections.

**1. Add the provider.** Place the `models` block between the `auth` and `agents` sections:

```json
"models": {
  "mode": "merge",
  "providers": {
    "claude-max-proxy": {
      "baseUrl": "http://claude-max-proxy:3456/v1",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "auth": "api-key",
      "apiKey": "ignored",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
          "name": "Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Max Proxy)"
        },
        {
          "id": "claude-opus-4-6",
          "name": "Claude Opus 4.6 (Max Proxy)"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
},
```

**2. Add the model allowlist.** Inside `agents.defaults`, add a `models` object that registers each model with a short alias. OpenClaw only exposes models listed here:

```json
"agents": {
  "defaults": {
    "contextPruning": { "mode": "cache-ttl", "ttl": "1h" },
    "compaction": { "mode": "safeguard" },
    "thinkingDefault": "high",
    "timeoutSeconds": 7200,
    "heartbeat": { "every": "1h" },
    "maxConcurrent": 8,
    "subagents": { "runTimeoutSeconds": 3600 },
    "models": {
      "claude-max-proxy/claude-sonnet-4-6": { "alias": "sonnet" },
      "claude-max-proxy/claude-opus-4-6": { "alias": "opus" }
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Set the primary model and fallbacks.** Edit `/opt/openclaw-home/.env`:

```
OPENCLAW_MODEL_PRIMARY=claude-max-proxy/claude-opus-4-6
OPENCLAW_MODEL_FALLBACKS=["claude-max-proxy/claude-sonnet-4-6"]
```

Restart the gateway:

```bash
make restart
```

Verify both models are registered:

```bash
openclaw models list
```

You should see both `claude-max-proxy/claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-max-proxy/claude-opus-4-6`. Switch between them in Discord with `/model`, or from the CLI with the alias (`/model opus`, `/model sonnet`).

Verify the proxy container is running:

```bash
make status
```

The `claude-max-proxy` container should appear alongside `openclaw-gateway` and `openclaw-browser-viewer`.

### Extended thinking

OpenClaw's `thinkingDefault` is not forwarded to OpenAI-compatible providers, so the proxy needs its own configuration. Levels match Claude CLI's `--effort`: `off | low | medium | high | xhigh | max`.

Set the default in `/opt/openclaw-home/.env`:

```
DEFAULT_THINKING_BUDGET=high
```

Change it at runtime without restarting:

```bash
make think LEVEL=high
make think LEVEL=max
make think                  # show current
```

Or hit the admin endpoint directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3456/admin/thinking-budget \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"budget": "max"}'
```

Clients can also set the level per request:

- OpenAI style — `"reasoning_effort": "high"` in the request body
- Anthropic style — `"thinking": { "type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 32000 }`
- Header — `X-Thinking-Budget: high`

#### Optional: wire up `/think` from Discord

To have Discord's `/think <level>` also update the proxy, install the bridge hook shipped with this repo:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/hooks/claude-max-proxy-think
cp hooks/claude-max-proxy-think/* ~/.openclaw/hooks/claude-max-proxy-think/
```

Enable it in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
"hooks": {
  "internal": {
    "entries": {
      "claude-max-proxy-think": { "enabled": true }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart OpenClaw (`make restart`). Now `/think high` in Discord updates the proxy automatically.
