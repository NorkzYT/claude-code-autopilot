# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

| Issue | What to check |
|-------|---------------|
| Autopilot not launching | Restart Claude Code and confirm `.claude/settings.local.json` exists |
| Command blocked | Review `.claude/hooks/guard_bash.py` and add a safe allowlist rule if needed |
| File edit blocked | Check protected file markers and sentinel rules |
| Formatting not working | Make sure the repo has formatter config files (`.prettierrc*`, `pyproject.toml`) |
| Hooks not running | Ensure the settings file used by Claude includes the hook config |
| `Ctrl+G` opens `nano` | Confirm VS Code integration requirements from `docs/editor.md` |

## Validate the kit setup

```bash
./.claude/extras/doctor.sh
```

## Agent Stops Mid-Task (Requires "Continue")

**Symptom:** The agent stops during a long-running task and requires the user to say "Continue." to resume.

**Log signature** (in `make logs`):
```
[agent/embedded] embedded run timeout: runId=... timeoutMs=600000
[agent/embedded] Profile anthropic:manual timed out. Trying next account...
[agent/embedded] embedded run failover decision: ... decision=surface_error reason=timeout
```

**Cause:** OpenClaw's default embedded run timeout is 600 seconds (10 minutes). Complex multi-step tasks exceed this limit.

**Fix:**

```bash
# Set to 2 hours (recommended) — applied automatically on next make update-agent
make set-timeout TIMEOUT=7200

# Or set directly inside the container
make shell
openclaw config set agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds 7200
```

Re-provisioning an agent with `make update-agent` also applies the 7200s default automatically.

**Verify:**
```bash
make shell
openclaw config get agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds
# Should output: 7200
```

## Discord Task Killed at ~30 Minutes ("Discord inbound worker timed out")

**Symptom:** A long task launched from Discord dies after roughly 30 minutes, even
though `agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds` is already 7200 (2h). The Discord reply
says **"Discord inbound worker timed out."**

**Log signature** (in `make logs` / proxy logs):
```
event=subprocess.kill reason=client_disconnected
event=subprocess.kill signal=SIGTERM
event=subprocess.close code=143
```

**Cause:** OpenClaw's Discord **inbound worker** has its own hard-coded ~30-minute
total wall-clock cap per inbound message. This is **separate from**
`agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds` — which is why raising the agent timeout never
helped. When the inbound cap trips, OpenClaw drops the connection to
`claude-max-proxy`; the proxy then SIGTERMs the in-flight Claude CLI on client
disconnect (`code=143` = 128 + SIGTERM). The gap between the start and the kill
in the log is exactly ~30 min.

**Fix:** raise `channels.discord.inboundWorker.runTimeoutMs` (milliseconds). 2h
matches the agent timeout so the agent's own graceful timeout becomes the limiter
instead of the channel's hard kill. `make setup-discord` now sets this
automatically; for existing installs:

```bash
# Set to 2 hours (7200000 ms)
make set-inbound-timeout TIMEOUT_MS=7200000
make restart

# Or directly inside the container
make shell
openclaw config set channels.discord.inboundWorker.runTimeoutMs 7200000
```

`openclaw.json` ends up with:
```jsonc
"channels": {
  "discord": {
    "inboundWorker": { "runTimeoutMs": 7200000 }
  }
}
```

Prefer a generous bound (e.g. 7200000) over disabling the cap entirely, so a
genuinely hung request can still be reclaimed.

**Verify:**
```bash
make shell
openclaw config get channels.discord.inboundWorker.runTimeoutMs
# Should output: 7200000
```

## Run Aborted Mid-Think at ~9.5 Minutes (no-progress watchdog)

**Symptom:** A long run on a heavy reasoning model (opus / fable at high
thinking) is killed partway through even though `agents.defaults.timeoutSeconds`
and `channels.discord.inboundWorker.runTimeoutMs` are both already raised to 1h+.
The gateway log shows a stalled-session warning around `lastProgressAge≈389s`
followed by an abort-drain near `age≈574s`:
```
[diagnostics] stuck session warn ... lastProgressAge=389s
[diagnostics] stuck session abort-drain ... age=574s
```

**Cause:** This is **not** a request timeout — it is OpenClaw's *no-progress
watchdog* (`diagnostics.stuckSessionWarnMs` / `diagnostics.stuckSessionAbortMs`).
It measures wall-clock since the run last streamed anything OpenClaw counts as
progress, and abort-drains the session for recovery once it crosses the abort
threshold. The built-in defaults (~6.5m warn / ~9.5m abort) were sized for fast
models; opus/fable with a large thinking budget can go minutes between visible
tokens, so a slow-but-healthy run trips the watchdog and dies mid-think. Fast
models (sonnet) rarely hit it.

**Fix:** raise both thresholds (milliseconds) so a genuinely-healthy slow run has
room to finish. 10m warn / 20m abort is the production profile:
```bash
make shell
make set-watchdog WARN_MS=600000 ABORT_MS=1200000
# or directly (note --strict-json so they store as numbers):
openclaw config set diagnostics.stuckSessionWarnMs 600000 --strict-json
openclaw config set diagnostics.stuckSessionAbortMs 1200000 --strict-json
make restart   # these keys are cached at boot — a gateway restart is required
```

In `openclaw.json`:
```jsonc
"diagnostics": {
  "stuckSessionWarnMs": 600000,
  "stuckSessionAbortMs": 1200000
}
```

On Docker hosts these are provisioned automatically on every boot by
`openclaw-ensure-timeouts` (override via `OPENCLAW_STUCK_SESSION_WARN_MS` /
`OPENCLAW_STUCK_SESSION_ABORT_MS`). Keep `abort` finite (e.g. 1200000) rather
than disabling it, so a genuinely hung session can still be reclaimed — `warn`
must stay below `abort` or it never fires.

**Verify:**
```bash
make shell
openclaw config get diagnostics.stuckSessionAbortMs
# Should output: 1200000
```

## Discord Plugin Not Installed ("plugin not installed: discord")

**Symptom:** On startup or in `make logs` you see:
```
plugins.entries.discord: plugin not installed: discord — install the official
external plugin with: openclaw plugins install @openclaw/discord
```

**Cause:** Discord support ships as an external OpenClaw plugin
(`@openclaw/discord`) installed into `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/npm` — a host bind
mount, so it can't be baked into the image. The gateway entrypoint installs it
automatically on **first boot**; this warning appears only if that install was
skipped (e.g. `OPENCLAW_INSTALL_DISCORD_PLUGIN=0`), failed (no network), or the
image predates the auto-install.

**Fix:**
```bash
docker exec openclaw-gateway openclaw plugins install @openclaw/discord --pin
make restart
```
A normal `make restart` on a current image is enough — the entrypoint installs
the plugin before launching the gateway if it isn't already present.

## Can't Access Host localhost From Container

**Symptom:** An agent inside the Docker container can't reach a dev server running on the host at `127.0.0.1:<port>`. `curl http://127.0.0.1:4000` fails with "Connection refused".

**Cause:** `127.0.0.1` inside the container is the container's own loopback, not the host's. Services bound to `127.0.0.1` on the host don't listen on the Docker bridge interface.

**Fix — Option A: Bind the dev server to `0.0.0.0`**

If possible, start your dev server on `0.0.0.0:<port>` instead of `127.0.0.1:<port>`. Then use `host.docker.internal:<port>` from inside the container.

**Fix — Option B: Use host networking mode**

```bash
make start-host    # or: make restart-host
```

This uses `network_mode: host` so the container shares the host's network stack. `127.0.0.1:4000` on the host IS `127.0.0.1:4000` in the container.

To switch back to normal bridge networking:

```bash
make start         # or: make restart
```

**Note:** In host networking mode, the gateway port is no longer mapped — it binds directly to the host. The browser viewer still works via `http://<host>:6080`.

## Browser Contention With Multiple Agents

**Symptom:** Multiple agents interfere with each other's browser tabs, navigation, or session state.

**Cause:** By default, all agents share a single Chromium instance (one X display :99, one CDP port, one profile).

**Fix:** Enable per-agent browser isolation:

1. Set `OPENCLAW_BROWSER_ISOLATION=per-agent` in your `.env` file
2. Rebuild: `make rebuild && make restart`

Each agent gets its own virtual X display (:100–:119), Chromium profile, and CDP port (18801–18820). The shared display :99 continues to serve the VNC viewer for manual use.

**Verify:**
```bash
make shell
ps aux | grep Xvfb                 # Should show :99 + per-agent displays
ls ~/.openclaw/browser-profiles/   # Per-agent profile directories
ls ~/.openclaw/display-locks/      # Active lock files
```

**Rollback:** Set `OPENCLAW_BROWSER_ISOLATION=shared` (or remove it) and `make rebuild`.

## Permission Denied: mkdir '/opt/github' (or other custom repo dir)

**Symptom:** `EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/opt/github'` when using Discord or other channels.

**Cause:** `HOST_REPOS_DIR` in `.env` is set to a custom path (e.g., `/opt/github`), but after the fix in this commit, the path is properly mounted. For older setups, the mount was hardcoded to `/opt/repos`.

**Fix (post-fix):** No action needed — custom `HOST_REPOS_DIR` values now work automatically.

**Legacy workaround (pre-fix):** Manually add the custom directory to docker-compose volumes and rebuild.
